                <h2>.. Timing Point ..</h2>
                <p>Do you often feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do?</p>
                <p>Do you often miss work on deadlines?</p>
                <p>Or do you sometimes forget to do something important, so people have to chase you to get the job done?</p>
                <p>Every day we certainly do activities, which are also known as routines. Even though it is done every day, it 
                    does not rule out the possibility of making us forget the routine that we must do. Everyone has their own way of 
                    avoiding that feeling of forgetfulness. Well, one of them is to make a to-do list or a list of what to do every day. 
                    Maybe you are one of those people who always make-do every day.</p>
